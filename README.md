## Notes
Go version 1.14

The idea of this project is to provide all the apis that exists in my other repository [NetCore.Playground.Api](https://github.com/joacod/NetCore.Playground.Api)

What we get from this:
- We practice different approaches in Node.js
- We can compare **Node.js** implementations with the same ones written in **.NetCore**
- We have two versions of the same Web Api written in different languages, that can be switched from a UI having the exact same results

I have created two UI projects to consume the APIs created here, you can use either of the following repositories:
- [Angular Playground](https://github.com/joacod/angular-playground-ui)
- [Vue Playground](https://github.com/joacod/vue-playground-ui)

## Prerequisites
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation and Setup
Coming soon...
